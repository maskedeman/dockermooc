# Example Frontend Docker Configuration

This project is nothing but my minimal portfolio. It only has frontend but no backend.

## Prerequisites

- Install Node.js.

    Example Node.js install instructions for LTS Node.js 16.x:

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
    ```

    Check your installation with:

    ```bash
    node -v && npm -v
    ```

- Install all packages with npm install.

## Starting in Production Mode

### To Run the Project

First, you need to build the static files with:

```bash
